## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Markup was easy to deploy. The CSS was tougher, I still have a lot to go especially the CSS grid


### Continued development

I would still need to practice more on most aspects of CSS styling especially on grid.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Course by freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6CBKf8K_Ac&t=2984s) - This helped me for achieving grid layouts, but still I would practice more because there are some screen sizes where the look is not that great.
